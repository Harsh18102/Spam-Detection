# Spam Detection and Emotion Detection

**Spam Detection and Emotion Detection** is a machine learning-based application designed to classify messages as spam or non-spam (ham) and to analyze the emotional tone of the input text. This project addresses the challenges of filtering unwanted messages and understanding the sentiment conveyed in user communications. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, it provides a reliable solution for message classification and emotion recognition.

### Functions
 - Spam Detection: Classifies messages as spam or ham using various machine learning models.
 - Emotion Detection: Analyzes input text to identify emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise.
 - Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, removal of stop words, and stemming/lemmatization.
 - Real-time Prediction:Allows users to input messages for instant spam classification and emotion detection.

### Technologies Used
 - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 - Backend: Python (Flask)
 - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, NLTK, or spaCy for natural language processing

### Requirements
  - Python
  - Flask
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
